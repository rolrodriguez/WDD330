    <h3>Exercises</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./WK04.html">Forms, OOP and Modern JS</a></li>

      </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          forms["form name"].elements returns a collection of the elements in the form
        </li>
        <li>
          Use event.preventDefault() to stop a form from being submitted
        </li>
        <li>
          In real-life we should use validation in both the front end and the back end.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we want to add additional functionality to an existing class we have to options:
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>To add the additional property to the prototype</li>
          <li>Create a new class inheriting from the class we want to use as a basis</li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          We can create a new instance of an already created object by using: let myObject = Object.create(NameOfObject)
        </li>
        <li>
          If a method returns this, its methods can be chained together to form a sequence of method calls that 
          are called one after the other.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) for our libraries we save downloading them again for the user
          if the same are used in other sites, like JQuery, Angular, and others.
        </li>
        <li>
          A code transpiler allows us to write code in the latest version of ECMAScript, using all the latest features,
          then convert it into an older variant of JavaScript that is compatible with most browsers. Babel is a famous 
          code transpiler.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How are input fields automatically updated with currency, phone number, or credit card number formats?
          Is this by just listening to a change in the field and updating the value as that format, or does
          that type of validation use something else behind the scenes?
        </li>
        <li>
          I found it confusing that we can create objects in so many ways: object literals, new instances from a class,
          instances from a prototype. Personally, I would only use the class based instantiation, are there any reasons
          where this method could not be used?
        </li>
        <li>
          I see there is a continuous argument about using vanillaJS, React, Vue or Angular. Based on market research
          what is the safest bet for us to land a job at the time? Personally, I like to build things myself using
          vanillaJS but I know that will not be the case will all projects, as some projects will require a faster
          time to deliver.
