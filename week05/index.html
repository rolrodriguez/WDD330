    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Strict mode has scope, it can be used per function.
          It would be useful to use this in a self-calling function as 
          other developers might not be compliant with strict mode 
          requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strict mode is enabled by default in modules, so it is not needed
          to add an statement with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          We should include feature detection statements before using a feature.
          Libraries like <a href="https://modernizr.com/docs">Modernizr</a> can 
          help to detect features.

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the text we read this week there is no mention about inheriting from the Error
          class to create or own error class, but I understand it is possible. Are there any
          restrictions from it
        </li>
        <li>
          For the TODO list we will be completing next week, we will be storing the tasks
          as part of a tasklist that is part of a JSON string. I worked on the interface and I'm
          pending the JSON and localstorage part of it. I guess we only need to use one object
          for localhost as we are using only one list for the complete app. Or should we
          use objects in localStorage for each task? I think it would be more complicated
          this way.
