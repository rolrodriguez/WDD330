          Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) are a useful way of performing a task 
          while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of the function. This means the 
          global namespace is not polluted with lots of variable names.

          A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don't do 
          anything that can't already be achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the process, 
          and avoid callback hell.

          Async functions were added to the ES2017 specification. These functions are preceded by the async 
          keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous. This is achieved by 
          using the await operator before an asynchronous function. This will wrap the return value of the 
          function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable.

    <h3>Questions:</h3>

        <li>
          I don't see any references to the old XMLHttpRequest object we used to create
          to make AJAX. Is it not used anymore? Should be used fetch from now on?
        </li>
        <li>
          I was surprised to see about functions that modify themselves. How frequent are these
          used?
        </li>
        <li>
          Using async and await seems cleaner than using Promises with then and catch.
          Are there drawbacks from using one or the other?
