    <h3>Exercises</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./WK01localStorage.html">LocalStorage</a></li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>LocalStorage uses key-value pairs to store data in the browser</li>
        <li>We need to design sites mobile first not just responsive, responsive normally means adding media queries to an 
          already desktop site, to make it more mobile friendly. Mobile first means that we first design it for mobile and 
          then we think about how will it look on bigger screens
        </li> 
        <li>Mobile first design makes us focus on simplicity and what is truly needed</li>
        <li>When designing a site for mobile, we need to place menus closer to the user, having menus at the bottom
          can help users to make your app/site more usable
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How is LocalStorage implemented? Is it a file created per site or is it a common file for all sites?</li>
        <li>How safe is LocalStorage? Can it be downloaded by the user?</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
