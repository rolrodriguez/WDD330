    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using namespaces help to avoid conflicts with functions of the same name, I guess similar to C++ it is safe
          to use our own namespace to avoid these conflicts.

        <li>
          During this week we had to use many of the iterator methods for the arrays. These methods are useful
          and help save to keep code simple and shorter.

        <li>
          The commonly used "event" and "e" names for the events are not mandatory any name will work.

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I had issues with the visibility of the "this" keyword, specially when a listener is added or removed from within a function. 
          Are there any good practices to check how references should be handled?
        </li>
        <li>
          In the textbook it is mentioned that it is preferable to have event listeners defined only on the JS side and not in the HTML,
           despite having there reference in two very distinct files, is there any other drawback?
        </li>
        <li>
          Some events and listeners are handled differently by other browsers(old versions of internet explorer for example) why are 
          things more standard now and not as much before? I see in JavaScript code we still have to use for certain functionality the webkit,moz or ie prefixes?
