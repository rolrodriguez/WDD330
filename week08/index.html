<h1>Week 08</h1>
<div id="content">
  <ul>
    <h3>Exercises</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./clock.html">Canvas clock</a></li>
        <li><a href="./vue-todo.html">VueJS simple todo app with components</a></li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We can use the short notation for transitions, to change from:
          <ul>
            <li>transition-property: transform;</li>
            <li>transition-duration: 0.2s;</li>
            <li>transition-timing-function: ease-out</li>
            <li>transition-delay: 50ms</li>
          </ul>
          To a more convenient one:
          <ul>
            <li>transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</li>
          </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          Several transitions can be declared with the short notation by separating them with commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a short hand notation for animations too, it helps changing from this:
          <ul>
            <li>animation-name: appearDisappear;</li>
            <li>animation-duration: 300ms;</li>
            <li>animation-timing-function: ease-in;</li>
            <li>animation-iteration-count: 1;</li>
            <li>animation-direction: alternate;</li>
            <li>animation-delay: 5s;</li>
          </ul>
          To this:
          <ul>
            <li>animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s alternate appearDisappear;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
         I see the transforms and animations are part of CSS3, how come we still have to use browser 
         specific commands in parallel? Is there a plan to standardize this? 
        </li>
        <li>
         Are there any good libraries to use Canvas? Are there any used to develop games?
        </li>
        <li>
          In the industry, is there a good rule of thumb when to use svg or canvas for real world applications?
          The text mentions one, but just wanted to know if there are good examples out there.
        </li>
        <li>
          We had drag and drop in web apps before CSS3, how was that implemented?
        </li>
      </ul>
