    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Both then and async/await can be used for fetch as both methods are used
          to work with promises
        </li>
        <li>
          There are two main methods for form validation:
          <ul>
            <li>Built-in form validation (uses HTML5 API)</li>
            <li>Javascript validation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite having client-side validation, we should implement 
          server-side validation, as it can be easily bypassed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
         The HTML5 validation API seems simple enough for many projects. Is there any
         benefit from running javascript custom validation to HTML5 validation, besides being more flexible?
        </li>
        <li>
         Is there a book or a style guide with good practices for validation of standard usage 
         (in addition to the articles mentioned)?
         I mean there should be standard validation for credit card numbers, phone numbers and more. 
        </li>
        <li>
          What is a good example of a situation where we would use fetch to receive cookies?
        </li>
        <li>
          For this week's team assignment I had issues to get my location with safari. According to a newer
          specification we cannot ask the user for his/her location if we are using an insecure domain (not https).
          How could we test for geolocation with this constraint for our applications?
        </li>
