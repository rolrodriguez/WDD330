    <h3>Exercises</h3>

        <li><a href="./WK02IndexedDB.html">Indexed DB data entering and retrieving</a></li>
        <li><a href="./WK02functions.html">Other functions</a></li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>DRY code, Don't repeat yourself</li>
        <li>
          Loops are the method used to repeat code execution. Execution can be interrupted by using "break" or certain
          iterations skipped by using "continue"
        </li>
        <li>
          Functions help to reduce repetition. Complexity comes from stacking functions that do one thing only
          quite well.

      </ul>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there a difference if we use an arrow function vs using other type of function definitions?</li>
        <li>In this week's group assignment we implemented the summing function using recursion, but some members 
          of the team, like myself wanted to use just a for loop. I suppose the for loop is less computational intensive,
          are there guidelines of what is better to solve with loops and what with recursion?</li>
        <li>With APIs such as the indexedDB api we have to assign funtions to events like onsuccess, onerror, but we
          have functions we want to have isolated (like to do just saving the record), is there an easy way to 
          have this function without including all the listeners?
